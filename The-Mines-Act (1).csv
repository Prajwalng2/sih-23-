"The Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Amendment Bill, 2021"
"*  The Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Amendment Bill, 2021 was introduced in Lok Sabha on March 15, 2021.  The Bill amends the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957.  The Act regulates the mining sector in India."
""
"* Removal of restriction on end-use of minerals: The Act empowers the central government to reserve any mine (other than coal, lignite, and atomic minerals) to be leased through an auction for a particular end-use (such as iron ore mine for a steel plant).  Such mines are known as captive mines.  The Bill provides that no mine will be reserved for particular end-use."
""
"* Sale of minerals by captive mines:  The Bill provides that captive mines (other than atomic minerals) may sell up to 50% of their annual mineral production in the open market after meeting their own needs.   The central government may increase this threshold through a notification.  The lessee will have to pay additional charges for mineral sold in the open market."
""
"* Auction by the central government in certain cases: Under the Act, states conduct the auction of mineral concessions (other than coal, lignite, and atomic minerals).  Mineral concessions include mining lease and prospecting license-cum-mining lease.  The Bill empowers the central government to specify a time period for completion of the auction process in consultation with the state government.  If the state government is unable to complete the auction process within this period, the auctions may be conducted by the central government."
""
"* Transfer of statutory clearances: Upon expiry of a mining lease (other than coal, lignite, and atomic minerals), mines are leased to new persons through auction.  The statutory clearances issued to the previous lessee are transferred to the new lessee for a period of two years.  The new lessee is required to obtain fresh clearances within these two years.  The Bill replaces this provision and instead provides that transferred statutory clearances will be valid throughout the lease period of the new lessee."
""
"* Allocation of mines with expired leases: The Bill adds that mines (other than coal, lignite, and atomic minerals), whose lease has expired, may be allocated to a government company in certain cases.  This will be applicable if the auction process for granting a new lease has not been completed, or the new lease has been terminated within a year of the auction.  The state government may grant a lease for such a mine to a government company for a period of up to 10 years or until the selection of a new lessee, whichever is earlier."
""
"* Rights of certain existing concession holders: In 2015, the Act was amended to provide that mines will be leased through an auction process.  Existing concession holders and applicants have been provided with certain rights including: (i) right to obtain prospecting licence or mining lease to a holder of reconnaissance permit or prospecting licence (issued before commencement of the 2015 Amendment Act), and (ii) right for grant of mining lease where the central government had given its approval or letter of intent was issued by the state government before the commencement of the 2015 Amendment Act.  The Bill provides that the right to obtain a prospecting license or a mining lease will lapse on the date of commencement of the 2021 Amendment Act.  Such persons will be reimbursed for any expenditure incurred towards reconnaissance or prospecting operations."
""
"* Extension of leases to government companies: The Act provides that the period of mining leases granted to government companies will be prescribed by the central government.  The Bill provides that the period of mining leases of government companies (other than leases granted through auction) may be extended on payment of additional amount prescribed in the Bill."
""
"* Conditions for lapse of mining lease: The Act provides that a mining lease will lapse if the lessee: (i) is not able to start mining operations within two years of the grant of a lease, or (ii) has discontinued mining operations for a period of two years.  However, the lease will not lapse at the end of this period if a concession is provided by the state government upon an application by the lessee.  The Bill adds that the threshold period for lapse of the lease may be extended by the state government only once and up to one year."
""
"* Non-exclusive reconnaissance permit: The Act provides for a non-exclusive reconnaissance permit (for minerals other than coal, lignite, and atomic minerals).  Reconnaissance means preliminary prospecting of a mineral through certain surveys.    The Bill removes the provision for this permit."
"* The Offshore Areas Mineral (Development and Regulation) Act, 2002 (17 of 2003) (OAMDR Act) and the Offshore Areas Mineral Concession Rules, 2006 (OAMCR Rules) govern the grant of mineral concessions in offshore areas in India."
"* Types of mineral concessions"
"* The following types of mineral concessions can be granted in offshore areas in India:"
"* Reconnaissance permit: This permit allows the holder to conduct preliminary surveys and investigations to identify potential mineral resources in a specified offshore area."
"* Exploration licence: This licence allows the holder to conduct more detailed exploration and evaluation activities to assess the quantity and quality of mineral resources in a specified offshore area."
"* Production lease: This lease allows the holder to extract and produce minerals from a specified offshore area."
"* Application procedure"
"* To apply for a mineral concession in an offshore area, the applicant must submit an application to the Ministry of Mines in the prescribed form. The application must be accompanied by a detailed exploration or development plan, as well as the prescribed application fee."
"* Grant of mineral concessions"
"* The Ministry of Mines will process the application and grant the mineral concession if it is satisfied that the applicant meets the eligibility criteria and has submitted a satisfactory exploration or development plan."

"* Reconnaissance permit: 3 years, renewable for a further period of 2 years."
"* Exploration licence: 10 years, renewable for a further period of 5 years."
"* Production lease: 50 years."
"* Rights and obligations of concession holders"
"* Concession holders have the exclusive right to explore for and produce minerals in the specified offshore area during the term of the concession. However, they are also subject to a number of obligations, including:"
"* Conducting exploration and development activities in accordance with the approved exploration or development plan."
"* Submitting regular reports to the Ministry of Mines on the progress of their activities."
"* Paying royalties to the Government of India on the minerals produced."
"* Protecting the environment and marine life in the offshore area."
"* Revocation of mineral concessions"
"* The Ministry of Mines may revoke a mineral concession if the concession holder fails to comply with the terms and conditions of the concession."
"* Other important provisions"
"* The OAMDR Act and OAMCR Rules also contain a number of other important provisions, such as provisions on:"
"* The maximum area that can be granted under a single mineral concession."
"* The transfer of mineral concessions."
"* The surrender of mineral concessions."
"* The resolution of disputes between concession holders and the Government of India."
"* The Offshore Areas Mineral (Development and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2023"
"* The Offshore Areas Mineral (Development and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2023 (OAMDR Amendment Act, 2023) was passed by the Parliament of India in August 2023. The OAMDR Amendment Act, 2023 introduces a number of changes to the OAMDR Act, 2002, including:"
"* Reducing the standard area of offshore blocks from 5 minutes latitude by 5 minutes longitude to 1 minute latitude by 1 minute longitude."
"* Limiting the maximum area that one entity can acquire under all concessions to 45 minutes latitude by 45 minutes longitude."
"* Establishing an Offshore Areas Mineral Trust, which will be funded by concession holders in addition to any royalty."

"*"
"* The Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2021 (MMDR Amendment Act, 2021) was passed by the Parliament of India in March 2021. The Act amended the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 (MMDR Act, 1957) in a number of ways."
"* Some of the key amendments made by the MMDR Amendment Act, 2021 include:"
"* Removal of restriction on end-use of minerals: The MMDR Act, 1957 empowered the central government to reserve any mine (other than coal, lignite, and atomic minerals) to be leased through an auction for a particular end-use (such as iron ore mine for a steel plant). Such mines are known as captive mines. The MMDR Amendment Act, 2021 removes this restriction, allowing all mines to be auctioned without any end-use restrictions. This is expected to increase competition and transparency in the mining sector."
"* Sale of minerals by captive mines: The MMDR Act, 1957 prohibited captive mines from selling any of the minerals produced by them in the open market. The MMDR Amendment Act, 2021 allows captive mines to sell up to 50% of their annual mineral production in the open market after meeting their own needs. This is expected to increase the availability of minerals in the market and reduce prices."
"* Introduction of a new category of mining license called the national mineral exploration trust (NMET) license: The NMET license is designed to promote mineral exploration in the country. It will be granted to companies that have a proven track record in mineral exploration. Holders of NMET licenses will have the exclusive right to explore minerals in a specified area for a period of five years."

"* Introduction of a new category of environmental clearance called the combined environmental clearance (CEC): The CEC would combine the environmental clearance required for projects under the EPA 1986 with the environmental clearance required for projects under the Forest Conservation Act, 1980. This was intended to streamline the environmental clearance process and reduce the time and cost involved in obtaining environmental clearances."
"* Exemption of certain projects from the environmental clearance process: The DELAB 2015 proposed to exempt certain projects from the environmental clearance process, such as minor mining projects and projects in certain notified areas. This was intended to reduce the burden on businesses and to promote economic growth."
"* Increase in the penalties for environmental violations: The DELAB 2015 proposed to increase the penalties for environmental violations, such as illegal discharge of pollutants and illegal mining. This was intended to deter environmental violations and to protect the environment."
"* The DELAB 2015 was welcomed by the industry, which saw it as a positive step towards simplifying the environmental clearance process and reducing the burden on businesses. However, the bill was also criticized by environmental groups, who argued that it would weaken environmental protection and lead to increased environmental degradation."
"* The DELAB 2015 was not introduced in Parliament and lapsed in January 2016. However, the MoEFCC is reportedly working on a new draft environmental law that is expected to be introduced in Parliament soon. The new draft law is expected to address some of the concerns raised about the DELAB 2015, such as the concerns about the weakening of environmental protection."

"* Removal of restriction on end-use of minerals: The MMDR Act, 1957 empowered the central government to reserve any mine (other than coal, lignite, and atomic minerals) to be leased through an auction for a particular end-use (such as iron ore mine for a steel plant). Such mines are known as captive mines. The MMDR Amendment Act, 2021 removes this restriction, allowing all mines to be auctioned without any end-use restrictions. This is expected to increase competition and transparency in the mining sector."
"* Sale of minerals by captive mines: The MMDR Act, 1957 prohibited captive mines from selling any of the minerals produced by them in the open market. The MMDR Amendment Act, 2021 allows captive mines to sell up to 50% of their annual mineral production in the open market after meeting their own needs. This is expected to increase the availability of minerals in the market and reduce prices."
"* Introduction of a new category of mining license called the national mineral exploration trust (NMET) license: The NMET license is designed to promote mineral exploration in the country. It will be granted to companies that have a proven track record in mineral exploration. Holders of NMET licenses will have the exclusive right to explore minerals in a specified area for a period of five years."
"* Establishment of a mineral exploration corporation (MEC): The MEC will be a public sector company that will undertake mineral exploration activities on its own or in partnership with private companies. The MEC will also play a role in promoting mineral exploration and in developing the skills and knowledge required for mineral exploration."
"* Increase in the royalty rates for certain minerals: The MMDR Amendment Act, 2021 increases the royalty rates for certain minerals, such as iron ore and bauxite. This is expected to generate more revenue for the government and to ensure that the state gets a fair share of the benefits of mining."
"* Impact of the MMDR Amendment Act, 2021:"
"* The MMDR Amendment Act, 2021 is expected to have a positive impact on the mining sector in India. The Act is designed to attract more investment into the sector, to increase the availability of minerals in the market, and to ensure that the benefits of mining are shared fairly with all stakeholders."
"* The MMDR Amendment Act, 2021 is a welcome step towards reforming the mining sector in India. The Act is expected to make the sector more efficient, transparent, and sustainable."

"coal -detereminations and forms of sulphur in the mines of india"
""
"* The primary forms of sulfur present in Indian coal are:"
"* Inorganic sulfur: This is the most common form of sulfur in coal and is present in the form of sulfides, such as pyrite (FeS2) and marcasite (FeS2). Inorganic sulfur is released into the atmosphere during coal combustion as sulfur dioxide (SO2), which is a major precursor to acid rain."
"* Organic sulfur: This form of sulfur is present in the form of thiols, sulfones, and sulfonates. Organic sulfur is released into the atmosphere during coal combustion as SO2 and hydrogen sulfide (H2S). H2S is a toxic gas that can cause serious health problems, including death."
"* In addition to these two main forms of sulfur, coal may also contain elemental sulfur and sulfate sulfur. However, these forms are present in much lower concentrations than inorganic and organic sulfur."
"* The amount of sulfur in Indian coal varies depending on the region and the coal seam. In general, coals from the eastern and central regions of India have higher sulfur contents than coals from the western and southern regions. The average sulfur content of Indian coal is around 1.5%, but can range from less than 1% to over 3%."
"* The high sulfur content of Indian coal is a major concern for the environment and human health. SO2 and H2S emissions from coal combustion contribute to acid rain, air pollution, and respiratory problems. In addition, the high sulfur content of Indian coal can lead to the formation of clinkers and slagging in coal-fired boilers, which can reduce the efficiency of the boiler and increase the risk of equipment failure."
"* There are a number of ways to reduce the sulfur content of coal, including:"
"* Coal washing: This process involves removing impurities from coal using water. Coal washing can significantly reduce the sulfur content of coal, but it is also an energy-intensive process."
"* Flue gas desulfurization (FGD): This process involves removing SO2 from flue gas using a variety of technologies, such as lime scrubbing and limestone injection. FGD is a very effective way to reduce SO2 emissions, but it is also a relatively expensive technology."
"* Coal blending: This process involves blending low-sulfur coal with high-sulfur coal to reduce the overall sulfur content of the coal. Coal blending is a relatively inexpensive way to reduce the sulfur content of coal, but it is not as effective as coal washing or FGD."
"* The Indian government has implemented a number of regulations to reduce sulfur emissions from coal combustion. These regulations include requiring coal-fired power plants to install FGD systems and to reduce the sulfur content of coal used in industry. As a result of these regulations, sulfur emissions from coal combustion in India have declined significantly in recent years. However, the high sulfur content of Indian coal remains a major challenge for the country in its efforts to reduce air pollution and improve public health."
"* Determinations"
"* The determination of sulfur in coal is an important process for both the coal industry and the environment. The coal industry uses sulfur content data to assess the quality of coal and to determine the best way to use it. Environmental regulators use sulfur content data to set limits on emissions from coal-fired power plants and other industrial facilities."
"* There are a number of different methods for determining the sulfur content of coal. The most common method is the proximate analysis, which is a laboratory test that measures the moisture, volatile matter, ash, and fixed carbon content of coal. The sulfur content of coal can be calculated from the ash content using the following equation:"
"* Sulfur content (%) = Ash content (%) x 0.5"
"* Another common method for determining the sulfur content of coal is the ultimate analysis, which is a laboratory test that measures the carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, sulfur, and oxygen content of coal. The sulfur content of coal can be calculated from the ultimate analysis using the following equation:"
"* Sulfur content (%) = Sulfur content (ultimate analysis) x 100"
"* In addition to the proximate and ultimate analyses, there are a number of other methods for determining the sulfur content of coal, such as X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and infrared spectroscopy."
"* Safety guidelines"
"* The following safety guidelines should be followed when working with sulfur in coal:"
"* Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), such as gloves, a respirator, and safety glasses."
"* Be aware of the hazards of sulfur exposure, such as skin irritation, respiratory problems, and eye damage."
"* Work in a well-ventilated area to avoid inhaling sulfur dust."
"* Wash hands thoroughly after handling sulfur."
"* If you experience any symptoms of sulfur exposure, such as skin irritation, respiratory problems, or eye damage, seek medical attention immediately."

"Import and Export"
"As per the present Import policy, coal can be freely imported (under Open General Licence) by the consumers themselves considering their needs based on their commercial prudence."
"Coking Coal is being imported by Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL) and other Steel manufacturing units mainly to bridge the gap between the requirement and indigenous availability and to improve the quality. Coal based power plants, cement plants, captive power plants, sponge iron plants, industrial consumers and coal traders are importing non-coking coal. Coke is imported mainly by Pig-Iron manufacturers and Iron & Steel sector consumers using mini-blast furnace."
"* India is the second largest producer of coal in the world, after China"
"* . However, India also imports a significant amount of coal to meet its domestic demand. In 2022-23, India imported 256.9 million tonnes of coal, up from 162.46 million tonnes in 2021-22."
"* India's coal imports are driven by a number of factors, including:"
"* Growing demand for coal: India's economy is growing rapidly, and this is driving up the demand for energy. Coal is a major source of energy in India, and it is used to generate electricity, power industries, and produce steel."
"* Shortfall in domestic production: India's domestic coal production is not able to meet the growing demand for coal. This is due to a number of factors, including geological challenges, environmental regulations, and labor shortages."
"* Cheap imports: Coal imports are relatively cheap, compared to the cost of domestic coal production. This is because India has access to cheap coal from countries such as Indonesia, Australia, and Russia."
"* India's coal exports are relatively small, compared to its coal imports. In 2022-23, India exported 167.8 million tonnes of coal, up from 123.4 million tonnes in 2021-22."
"* India's coal exports are mainly to neighboring countries such as Nepal, Bangladesh, and Bhutan. India also exports some coal to other countries, such as Japan and Korea."
"* The Indian government is working to reduce India's dependence on coal imports. The government is investing in renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power. The government is also working to improve the efficiency of coal-fired power plants."
"* However, coal is likely to remain a major source of energy in India for many years to come. Therefore, India's coal imports will continue to play an important role in meeting India's energy needs."
"* Foreign Direct Investment in Coal Sector"
"* Posted On: 12 DEC 2022 4:01PM by PIB Delhi"
"* No foreign company is eligible to participate in auction for commercial mining as per extant policy. However, companies incorporated in India are eligible to participate."
"* Foreign Direct Investment of Rs.119.19 crores in FY-2022-23 has been made for one coal mine located in Jharkhand."
"* Government has reviewed the Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) policy in the coal mining on 18.09.2019 allowing 100% FDI under automatic route for sale of coal, coal mining activities including associated processing infrastructure subject to the provisions of the Coal Mines (Special Provisions) Act, 2015 and Mines and Mineral (Development & Regulation) Act, 1957 as amended from time to time and other relevant Acts on the subject. Associated processing infrastructure includes coal washery, crushing, coal handling and separation (magnetic and non-magnetic). DPIIT has circulated consolidated FDI policy circular 2020 vide OM dated 17.12.2020."
"* Further, according to the Press Note 3 of 2020, the Central Government further amended the FDI Policy to prescribe a requirement to seek prior Government approval if such foreign direct investment is by an entity from a country which shares land borders with India or where the beneficial owner of such foreign direct investment into India is situated in or is a citizen of any such country."
"* All the currently operating coal mines have valid environmental clearances for the part of the mine which is in operation. For a mine to become operational environmental clearance is mandatory."
"*"
"FURTHER INSTRUCTION REGARDING NEW COAL DISTRIBUTION POLICIES FROM 2011."
"* The New Coal Distribution Policy (NCDP) was issued by the Ministry of Coal, Government of India, in 2011. The NCDP was introduced to reform the coal distribution system in India and to make it more transparent and efficient."
"* The NCDP introduced a number of new features, including:"
"* Coal linkages: The NCDP introduced a system of coal linkages, which are contracts that guarantee the supply of coal at a predetermined price for a specified period of time. Coal linkages are allocated to consumers through a transparent and competitive bidding process."
"* Priority consumers: The NCDP introduced a classification of consumers into priority and non-priority categories. Priority consumers, such as power plants, railways, and defense organizations, are entitled to receive coal linkages on a priority basis."
"* Non-priority consumers: Non-priority consumers, such as industries such as cement, steel, and sponge iron, are not entitled to receive coal linkages on a priority basis. They may have to compete with other consumers for coal linkages, and they may not be able to secure a linkage if the demand for coal is high."
"* Linkage price: The NCDP introduced a system of linkage price, which is the price that a consumer pays for coal. The linkage price is determined by Coal India Limited (CIL), the largest coal producer in India, on a quarterly basis."
"* Coal imports: The NCDP also allows for the import of coal to meet the shortfall in domestic coal production. Coal imports are regulated by the Ministry of Coal."
"* Online platform for coal distribution: The NCDP introduced an online platform for coal distribution, which is called the Coal e-Auction System (CAS). The CAS is a transparent and efficient system for the allocation of coal linkages. The NCDP has been successful in reforming the coal distribution system in India. The system is now more transparent and efficient. However, there are still some challenges that need to be addressed. For example, the demand for coal is still growing, and the domestic coal production is not able to meet the growing demand. This is leading to higher coal prices."
"* The Indian government is working to address these challenges. The government is investing in renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power. The government is also working to improve the efficiency of coal-fired power plants."
"* The NCDP is an important policy for the coal sector in India. The policy is helping to meet the growing demand for coal and to ensure a reliable and affordable supply of coal for all consumers."
